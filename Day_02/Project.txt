Basic:
  Add a Task:
    Users should be able to add a new to-do item.
    Each task should have a description and a unique ID.
  View Tasks:
    Display all tasks in the to-do list with the following details:
      Task ID
      Description
      Status (e.g., Pending, Done)
    The list should be easy to read.
  Mark as Done:
    Users should be able to mark a specific task as "done" by its ID.
  Delete a Task:
    Users should be able to delete a task by its ID.

Optional Features (Nice-to-Have)
  Persistent Storage:
    The application should save the to-do list to a file, so data is not lost when the program is closed.
    The data should be loaded automatically when the program starts.
  Filter Tasks:
    Allow users to filter tasks by their status (e.g., view only "Pending" or "Done" tasks).
  Edit Tasks:
    Provide a way to update the description of an existing task.
